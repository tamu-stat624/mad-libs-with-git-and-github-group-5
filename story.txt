Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Tanmay,

I am writing to you from a fast spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Blue rocket in April. There are 7 mountains and spoons of fork here! In the
bedroom there is a pool full of soda. I fall asleep each night on a rosy bed of
cotton and dream of racing fast. It feels as though I have lived here for four
 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
sleeping on a slowly rover!!

Best wishes,
Phanender
